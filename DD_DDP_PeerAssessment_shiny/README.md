This is the supporting documentation for my Shiny App.  

## Application Overview / Documentation 

This is an overview of the Shiny App.               

This application allows a user to enter a set of x, y pairs of numbers and to fit a LM to it.  \
It is meant as a quick learning tool for students new to fitting models to data. 
    

## Use 

This is how you run and use the App.  After loading the app...  

First, enter Raw Data Points to the left.  Next, choose Options in the middle.  The Model Form 
defines your choice in how y relates to x. The Plot Display defines your choice of whether to 
display the Raw Data Points or Model Fit or both.  You can also choose the Chart Title and the 
x and y Axis Labels. After entering the Raw Data Points to fit, and the Options in the middle, 
hit the Submit button.  Lastly, the plot of Raw Data Points and the Model Fit (depending on the 
Options you choose) appears to the right.

## Remarks 

Again, this Shiny application could be expanded in numerous ways in the future, but as presented here, provides a basis for understanding model fitting.
